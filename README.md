# ClearTerms

**ClearTerms** is a free, ad-free, open-source app that translates Terms of Service and Privacy Policies into clear, understandable language using AI.

## 🌍 Mission
We believe clarity is a right, not a privilege. Our goal is to make digital contracts understandable for everyone — not just lawyers or tech experts.

## 🚫 The Problem
Millions of people agree to terms they never read or understand. Companies exploit this with dense legalese. ClearTerms fixes that.

## ✅ What It Does
- Paste or upload any Terms of Service
- AI generates plain-English summaries
- Users can download summaries as PDFs
- No ads, no tracking, no payment required

## 🛠 Built With
- React + React Native
- Node.js + Express

- Stripe (for optional donations)
- OpenAI (GPT-powered summarization)
